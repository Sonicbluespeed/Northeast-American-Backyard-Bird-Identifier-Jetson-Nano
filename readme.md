# Project Name Northeast-American-Backyard-Bird-Identifier

 Add short description of project here > 
The AI identifies 5 of the most common types of backyard birds in the northeastern U.S using image classification.  The five types of birds that can be identified are American Robin, Blue Jay, Male Northern Cardinal, Mourning Dove, and Red Winged Blackbird.  This project, which identifies the type of backyard bird on an image, can be educational for children and be helpful for bird watchers who are looking for specific types of birds that visit backyards in the region.

## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 
This project was developed on Jetson Nano.  The backyard bird image data set was intially obtained from kaggle.  The original set, which contained 16 bird types, was reduced to 5 bird types in order to decrease the time for training the model.
